generations:
  - name: "First Generation (SJ)"
    start_year: 1963
    end_year: 1991
    description: "The original Jeep Wagoneer was a pioneering luxury SUV that remained in production with only evolutionary changes for nearly three decades. Designed by Brooks Stevens, it featured a blend of rugged capability and upscale appointments previously unseen in four-wheel drive vehicles. Built on a traditional body-on-frame platform with solid axles front and rear, it initially offered independent front suspension in some variants—unusual for its time. Powertrain options evolved significantly throughout its long production run, beginning with overhead-cam inline-six and V8 engines from Willys and later incorporating AMC's inline-six and V8 powerplants. The interior was notably luxurious for a utility vehicle of its era, especially in later Grand Wagoneer models with wood-grain exterior trim, leather seating, power accessories, and air conditioning. The model evolved from the initial Wagoneer to the Super Wagoneer and ultimately the Grand Wagoneer as it moved increasingly upmarket. A major distinguishing feature was its four-wheel drive system designed for all-weather capability rather than just off-road use—a revolutionary concept that anticipated the modern SUV. Production continued through AMC's acquisition by Chrysler, with the Grand Wagoneer's final years positioned as a premium offering in Jeep's lineup. This generation developed a cult following for its classic design, luxury features, and capability, becoming one of the longest-produced automotive designs in American history."

  - name: "Second Generation (XJ)"
    start_year: 1983
    end_year: 1990
    description: "The second-generation Wagoneer is an upscale version of the unibody-based compact XJ Cherokee produced between 1983 and 1990. The compact XJ Wagoneer was available in two trim levels: the 'Wagoneer' and the 'Wagoneer Limited'. These vehicles were intended to replace the SJ-body Wagoneer models, but high demand prompted American Motors and Chrysler after 1987 to keep the original SJ-body Wagoneer in production. This generation represented a shift toward more car-like unibody construction and smaller dimensions while maintaining the Wagoneer name's luxury positioning. It competed in the emerging compact SUV segment against vehicles like the Chevrolet Blazer and Ford Bronco II while offering more upscale appointments than its Cherokee sibling."

  - name: "Third Generation (ZJ)"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 1993
    description: "The Wagoneer nameplate was reintroduced for one year as the top-of-the-line model of the Jeep ZJ platform that debuted on the mid-size Grand Cherokee for the 1993 model year. Called the Grand Wagoneer, it featured a long list of standard equipment, including the Magnum 5.2 L V8 engine and unique leather interior as well as the Grand Wagoneer's traditional exterior woodgrain applique. After 6,378 were produced, the model was dropped for 1994, leaving the Grand Cherokee Limited as the top-of-the-line Jeep. This brief revival brought the iconic nameplate to the modern unibody Grand Cherokee platform before the name would disappear for nearly three decades until its 2021 revival."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (WS)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "After a 30-year hiatus, the Wagoneer nameplate returned as Jeep's full-size premium SUV offering, positioned above the Grand Cherokee in size and luxury. Built on a body-on-frame architecture shared with the Ram 1500 but with an independent rear suspension, it combines traditional SUV capability with modern refinement. Available in standard Wagoneer and more luxurious Grand Wagoneer variants, with both offering extended-length L models starting in 2023. The exterior design is more restrained than other Jeep models, notably without the signature seven-slot grille, as the Wagoneer is positioned as a distinct premium sub-brand. Powertrain options initially included a 5.7L V8 with eTorque mild-hybrid system in the Wagoneer and a 6.4L V8 in the Grand Wagoneer, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. For the 2023 model year, Hurricane twin-turbocharged inline-six engines became available, offering improved efficiency with 420 HP in the Wagoneer and 510 HP in the Grand Wagoneer. The interior showcases unprecedented luxury for a Jeep product, with the Grand Wagoneer featuring up to seven digital screens totaling nearly 45 inches of display area, including a dedicated passenger screen. Materials include real wood, aluminum, and premium leather with quilted stitching. Advanced technology includes Uconnect 5 infotainment, available McIntosh audio systems with up to 23 speakers, and comprehensive driver assistance features. Despite its luxury focus, the Wagoneer maintains capability with three available four-wheel drive systems, Quadra-Lift air suspension, and up to 10,000 pounds of towing capacity. This generation reestablishes the Wagoneer as a premium American SUV, competing with established full-size luxury SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator while offering distinctive Jeep brand heritage."
